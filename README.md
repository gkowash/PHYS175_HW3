_____GRIFFIN_KOWASH_2020-02-13_hw3-1.cxx_____
Loads newline-delimited data from a text file specified as a command line argument and stores in a vector. Calculates sum,
mean, and root-mean-square of data and prints to the console.


_____GRIFFIN_KOWASH_2020-02-13_hw3-2.cxx_____
Contains code exercise copied from the assignment sheet.


_____GRIFFIN_KOWASH_2020-02-13_hw3-2.txt_____
Describes analysis of the code in GRIFFIN_KOW..._hw3-2.cxx and discusses behavior of pointers, arrays, and memory addresses.


_____GRIFFIN_KOWASH_2020-02-13_hw3-3.cxx_____
Defines a four-vector class with methods to set the energy and momentum components, find invariant mass and pseudorapidity,
and calculate difference in azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity compared to another four-vector. Creates two four-vector
instances, computes various values, and prints to the console for demonstration.
